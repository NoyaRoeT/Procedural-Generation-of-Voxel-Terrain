1. Winding Direction:
- By default front-facing triangles in OpenGl are CCW Winded.

2. Handedness in OpenGL
- OpenGl uses Right-handed coordinate systems, but is left-handed in NDC due to projection matrix reversing handedness.

3. Make sure to initialise GLAD before using any OpenGL Functions
- Might accidentally call an OpenGL function before initialising GLAD when creating abstractions with classes/functions.
This would lead to accessing uninitialised memory/nullptr.

4. Reading an entire textfile into a string using ifstream and stringstream
- We first open the files using ifstream. To allow exceptions to be thrown in case this fails, we use ifstream::exceptions and a try-catch block.
- We then use rdbuf and << into the stringstream. stringstream::str() to then copy the contents into a string object.

ToDo List:
1. Texture Atlas Class: BlockID/BlockCoords Input -> 4 Texture Coordinates as output (Problaby using some struct)
2. Chunk Class: Generate Chunktable which represents the chunk, generating chunk mesh data, destroying chunks
3. Chunk Renderer: Since mesh data is generated in Chunk class, need only render that data.

Optional:
- Improve First Person Camera
