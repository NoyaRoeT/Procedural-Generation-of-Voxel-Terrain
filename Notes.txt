1. When a vector grows, it is moved to a new location
- This move destroys the original object, hence the destructor is called. This resulted in the pointer of ChunkData being copied,
but the data itself on the heap being deleted which lead to a subscript error.
- Used shared_ptrs instead.


ToDo List:
- Only load chunks when crossing chunk border;
- Make a chunk loading queue so that chunk loading doesn't freeze the game every time.

Optional:
- Improve First Person Camera

Bugs:
- Block breaking doesn't work in negative x chunk coords.
