# Procedural Generation of Voxel Terrain Demo
This is my first attempt at a minecraft-like world with procedural generation using 2D noise functions.

I was recommened this video by Youtube: [Coding Minecraft in One Week - C++/OpenGL Programming Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq3isov6mZ8&t=169s)

The video sparked my interest in procedural generation of 3D voxel terrain and the result is this project. Unlike the video, the furthest I went was simply rendering a hilly grass terrain where stone textures were used for leaves. By then, school had started and my curiosity was mostly satisfied.
