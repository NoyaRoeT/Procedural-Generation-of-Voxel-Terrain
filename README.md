# Procedural Generation of Voxel Terrain Demo
This is my first attempt at a minecraft-like world with procedural generation using 2D noise functions.

The project was inspired by : [Coding Minecraft in One Week - C++/OpenGL Programming Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq3isov6mZ8&t=169s)

To run the program, you need to setup OpenGL for your project. My setup was done following [this tutorial.](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window)
